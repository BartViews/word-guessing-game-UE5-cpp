# word-guessing-game-UE5-cpp
Written in UE5 version of C++ - a BullCows Word Guessing game.

This is my second project based on Section 3 of "Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games" Udemy course. 
Though it is based on the course, the code is personalised and has additional functions.

Game code is located in BullCowCartridge.cpp file, functions are called in BullCowCartridge.h header file and word list is contained in HiddenWordList.h header file.

Attaching only the Source files as whole dev kit is too big.
